// For widget payments:
Suiflow.payWithWidget({
  merchantId: 'YOUR_MERCHANT_ID',
  amount: amount,
  onSuccess: function(txHash, paidAmount) {
    // Emails are automatically sent after verification
    console.log('Payment successful and receipts sent!');
  }
});
```

### Manual Receipt Sending
```javascript
// Send receipt manually (backend)
const response = await fetch('/api/payments/send-receipt', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    senderEmail: 'customer@example.com',
    paymentId: 'payment_id_here'
  })
});
```
